PART II
Python
1.  How do I run my code from the terminal?
Python3 name of the file

2.  What can I use to reference a value later in my code?
value = ()
3.  How can I make my program display text or some value in my terminal?
print(name_of_value)

4.  How can I make my code make decisions on which code to execute?
create a function that will make sure there isn't an infinite loop 

5.  How can I repeat blocks of code based on conditions?
The function that will make sure there isn't an infinite loop 

6.  Why is it critical to ensure that our conditions eventually become false when repeating blocks of code?
Because we will have an infinite Loop

7.  What are sequences and what are the differences between them?
sequences is an ordered set of values, strings or floats, integers. 

8.  How do I access a value within the various types of sequences?
index[] name the index place to acces 

9.  What is an index when talking about sequences?
List zero-based range 
10. What is the index of the first value within a sequence?
index[0] it is 0 zero-based range 

11. How can I add or remove a value from a sequence?
index.pop[]

12. What is the index of the last value within a sequence?
index[-1]

13. How can I get the length of a sequence?
range()

14. What can I use to reference and use a block of code later in my code?
variable[]
variable = []

15. What is DRY?
Do.Not.Repeat.Yourself

16. What is Scope? Provide an example.
Scope is the block of code. Python scope contains the name that is define inside the function. 

17. What is the difference between parameters and arguments?
18. What is recursion?
def factorial_recursive(n):
    #Base case: 1! = 1
        return 1
    #Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)
    else: 
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1)    

19. How can you return a value from a function?
if wallet = 100 if statements 

20. Describe a dictionary. How and why would it be useful?
Dictionary is {} key value or pairs. I can be dictionary{"first_name": "Debbie": "age": 21}
print(user["age"]) 

21. How can you remove a value from a dictionary?
index.remove[] or index.pop[]

22. How can you access and change values within a dictionary?
I access the values by index[0] change a index.insert[]

23. What data types can a sequence hold?
Intergers 12345...


24. What data types can a dictionary hold?
"strings" integers 
25. How can you iterate through a dictionary?
You can create a for loop


26. What is object oriented programming?
Classes are object oriented. 


27. Describe a class? Why are they useful?
Object oriented programming like a blueprint. They useful because it gives great detail and seperation. 

28. What are class properties? How would I give a class an initial set of properties?
By categories like for instance a car can be a class. Infiniti Sedan Q50 Pearl White, Sports model

29. What are class methods?
Abilities, functionality

30. What is inheritence?

31.  What are the various data types?
"strings"
Integers 1224 whole numbers
Float 213.345 decimal point
Boolean True/False
List []
Dictionary {}
